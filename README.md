<br/>
<p>
 This game was made as a gift for my twin sisters. <br/>
 I drew and animated all characters, collectables, obstacles and UI. <br/>
 <br/>
 Players have to cooperatively steer the sled down the mountain <br/> 
 by holding down the corresponding buttons simultaneously. <br/>
 The game speeds up as time passes (similar to Tetris). <br/>
 There are fireworks when the record is broken. <br/>
 <br/>
 I uploaded only the code and not the whole project <br/>
 because of the music which is not royalty-free, and also because  <br/>
 I didn't want to make their characters easily accessible to the public. <br/>
